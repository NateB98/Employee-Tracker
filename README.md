# Employee-Tracker

I have created an employee tracker using node.js along with mysql2, inquirer, and console.table.
In order to run this you need to source the schema, then use employee_tracking_db, after switching to that
database, source the seed file path and follow that with node server.js and it will open the prompt for you to choose to
view all employees, add and employee, update employee, view all roles, add a role, view all departments, add a department, or just quit.
selecting any one other than quit will result in more prompts for input and it will take your input to generate new items into the database.
